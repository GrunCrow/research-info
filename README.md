# Bibliography

Welcome to the Bibliography repository! Here, you will find a collection of academic papers, articles, books, and resources related mainly to the application of Deep Learning in the conservation and study of the environment.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into thematic folders that cover different aspects of ecology where Deep Learning is applied. Below, you will find a brief description of each folder and its contents:

### [Computer Vision](ComputerVision)

This folder contains literature related to the detection and classification of objects from images.

#### [Camera Trapping](ComputerVision/CameraTrapping)

This folder contains literature related to the detection and classification of species from images captured by camera traps in the wilderness.

### [Acoustics](Acoustics)

Here, you'll find resources on the use of Deep Learning algorithms in the analysis of sounds and vocalizations.

#### [BioAcoustics](Acoustics/BioAcoustics)

Here, you'll find resources on the use of Deep Learning algorithms in the analysis of sounds and vocalizations of wildlife, especially birds and mammals.

### [Other](Other)

This section includes literature that encompasses other aspects that don't fit into the previous categories.

## Contributions

If you have recommendations for articles, research, or books that you believe should be included in this repository, feel free to contribute! You can do so through pull requests or by opening an issue to suggest new additions.
